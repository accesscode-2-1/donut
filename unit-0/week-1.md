### Retrospective

**John Gomez**

* This week's medium post: https://medium.com/@lighterletter/computing-3-2-15-14ae12abb9b9
* Last week’s goal: Get more comfortable with Git and GitHub, and setting up my workspace. 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I have a better understanding of the system, and with today's class I got a better idea of how to set up my workspace.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I wanted to organize the files that I already uploaded to GitHub, and organize the exercices we had.
* What is your goal for next week? Aside from the regular work I want to re-upload the previous exercices in an organized way. 
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) solidifying the "Scanner" and the "if and else" statement.

* Last week’s goal: Post my first Medium story and tweet
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I met all my goals, and I practiced myt Git and GitHub during office hours.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Organizing the repository.

* Last week’s goal: Get better with Git and GitHub
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) I was able to get better with Git and GitHub, learning the commands and the ability to upload the file to GitHub.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) If I knew how to add each file independent and commit them, instead of all together.
* What is your goal for next week? Learn new topics and get more busy if code. Actually know the syntax used instead of going back and look at them.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Learning more about the java library (read), become a TA to effectively communicate tech ideas.

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? (1) Three axes are useful at looking at ourselves and how we view the world. It breaks down what's going on in our heads when we tell ourselves stories. (2) How methodologies help us break down complex problems.
* 
* How does this think piece relate to access code? We realize that not only do we have to constantly problem solve in our programs and dealing with things like Git and Github, but as humans beings we have to learn how to explain things to ourselves in the real world situation and be able to voice ourselves. Also, how to develop ourselves both professionally and personally.

### TODOs
* Communicate more with each other via our private slack pod group.
* Apply the skills we learned from the think piece, Optimism.
