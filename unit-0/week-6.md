Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

What are 2 things you took from this think piece?

*No matter what you care about, you can use coding and technology to solve any problem in society. 

*Programming is a good way for under represented populations to solve problems within their own demographic.


How does this think piece relate to access code?

It actually has a big impact related to access code, at this point some of us are having problems finding ourselves in society not only related to working but also the difficulties that we face in having different backgrounds. Also, that at some point in life we go through different situations but we have to remind ourselves that we can actually make it positive.

TODOs

BE AWESOME!
