### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? 
* The idea of fight or flight comes into play into learned helplessness, but you don't actually flee from the situation but freeze in the moment
* As with the Optimism piece, learned helplessness is where we are pessimists but need to change this mindset

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
* It is important to know there is a way out to us feeling helpless, with learning the materials but also when we get stuck on a problem in our assignments. 

### TODOs
Complete all assignments and make sure we support each other to learn the materials

### Extra comments / Anything you want your program managers to know


### Next Week

* Next Week’s think piece: TBD
