### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? 
* It's not the idea of being wrong we worry about but the feeling we have of realizing we're wrong that makes us want to be right all the time.
 Thus, our identity ties in with belieiving we're right.

* How does this think piece relate to access code?
* We could look at being wrong as a temporary thing and not hold onto that as a permamanenet thing. We acknowledge ourselves of being wrong and build ourselves up from it as a learning process.

### TODOs
