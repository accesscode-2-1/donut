* What went well (what goals did you meet?): Got accepted and had a great first day learning and meeting folks and getting inspired and ready.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?): Things went well but I definitely had questions and needed help from fellow students and TAs.
* What is your goal for next week? Get comfortable with Git and Github, but especially Git and the terminal.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) My goal for the week (see above). It's going to happen on my own AND with help from fellow pod members.

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? Kevin talked about how Android developers are in demand and if we can get proficient, we'll have lots of job interviews. He also talked about how what we're capable of matters more than any degree or resume. From Paola: you will face adversity but persistence pays off, you must keep learning until you're really proficient.  Also we really liked seeing a woman speak and have her as a role model. Both of them are in charge of Meetups that we want to check out.
* 
* How does this think piece relate to access code? Kevin's talk helped acclimate us to the culture of Android developers/programming in general. He said how important it is to keep learning. We noticed how it related to the C4Q values. Paola's talk gave us the real perspective because she was in Access Code 1.0, whereas Kevin has been doing programming longer (from age 7 to now in his mid-30s!). So we got the perspectives of a recent former student and also the owner of Touch Lab.

### TODOs
*Create and use the slack group for our fellow Donuts!
*Each of us tweet at least once this week and also do our Medium posts (one each).

### Extra comments / Anything you want your program managers to know
We think it would be great if we could get a more detailed outline for this Unit 0 we're in currently that could help us anticipate what's coming in the next few weeks.

### Next Week
