### Retrospective

**Allison**

* This week's medium post: <a href="https://medium.com/@alizinha/access-code-2-1-week-5-my-first-ever-code-review-b89b8dcbbb78:>My first-ever code review!</a>
* Last week’s goal: Devote more time to practice coding using online sites by myself
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) What's good is I did make study time in addition homework time. However, I ended up more reviewing concepts than practicing online problems.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) If I had somehow had more time, I would have gotten to doing online problems. However, I felt I needed that reviewing FIRST!
* What is your goal for next week? Same as last week's.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Lots of stuff, I'll come to office hours like I do every week!

**Elvis**

* This week's medium post: To come.
* Last week’s goal: Get more comfortable with methods and classes
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) It went well, getting better. Friday's review helped.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) I need to start practicing previous homeworks.
* What is your goal for next week? Learn more about classes and methods, constructors, objects, etc.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Same as above.

**Marbella**

* This week's medium post: <a href="https://medium.com/@Vidals047M/tips-for-understanding-your-code-76b2d4eb6ad8">Tips for understanding your code</a>
* Last week’s goal: Using array lists within classes and constructors
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) Nothing went well. More lost now. Feeling more lost after this morning's exercise.
* What could have gone better? Getting used to applying it in different scenarios.
* What is your goal for next week? Same as last week's but also to go back to previous homeworks to review.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Array lists, classes, and constructors.

**John**

* This week's medium post: <a href="https://medium.com/@lighterletter/the-uniforms-consciousness-wears-7e091be78e95">The uniforms consciousness wears.</a>
* Last week’s goal: To finish organizing the repos and review the class notes covered thus far
* What went well (what goals did you meet?) It didn't go well because was very pressed for time this week.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Just frustrated because didn't get to do as much as planned.
* What is your goal for next week? Get done previous week's goal.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Generally just study more.

**Sarah Kim**

* This week's medium post:<a href="https://medium.com/@sarahkim0925/pair-programming-6deb0cf387b9">Pair programming</a>
* Last week’s goal: Time myself with coding.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?): What went well is that I timed myself. What was "bad" was how long it took to do a lot of the problems.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?) Not getting the logic of pseudocode turned into code that works properly.
* What is your goal for next week? To keep getting better with the pseudocoding, to comprehend what code I should implement.
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can) Logic!


### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? 
* Body language is a form of communication and you're communicating your aspirations through a form of practice.
* That "faking it til you make it" really can work where eventually you really DO make it. You're not really even "faking" so much as you're giving yourself the benefit of the doubt.


* How does this think piece relate to access code?
* If you feel like you're not "getting it" with what we're learning, there are students, TAs, and teachers here to believe in us that we'll make it (just like Cuddy's personal experience at the end of the talk).
* The ability to be a programmer ties very much into what you believe about yourself as a person.

### TODOs
BE. AWESOME!
