### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? 
* 
* The think piece relates to last week's in the sense that you can't let your failures define who you are and it's not often the best or the smartest who succeeds but instead those who choose to persevere against whatever the odds may be. Another great and strong point is that anybody with enough Grit in itself can become whatever they choose to be. regardless of where their carreer or life might have taken them. 
* 
* 
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
* One mustn't let themselves be defeated by temporary failures, what makes the difference between our success in this program is our determination to give it our best despite our shortcomings.
