### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece? *Defining our strenghts gives us a better understanding of where we stand professionally. *Knowing them can help us work on our weaknesses.
*
*How does this think piece relate to access code? Having a clear idea of where you stand can help you understand what you need to work on. Accesscode challenges us to notice our own weaknesses and use our strenghts to help each other and ourselves as we move through the porogram. Preparing for an interview is just one aspect of preparing yourself as a person in terms of the qualities innate to us that can be helpful to others. Which is what an employer looks for. The person with the skills necessary to move the company forward.
