### Weekly Retrospective

####1. Did you meet your weekly goals?
       No.



####2. If not, which ones didn't you meet and why? All the members of our group still need to bring our horoscope apps to 
       total completion. We're going to spend at least 3-5 hours this week on improving our horoscope apps, in 
       addition to our other class assignments, studying, and new homework.



####3. What will you do as a team to make sure you meet your goals next week?
      Check in with each other and remind each other, both via slack and in person during classes/office hours/meeting
      independently with each other. (For instance, Sarah and Allison worked together today during lunch hour on the 
      morning's assignment.)

### Next Week

* Next Weekâ€™s team leader: Elvis Boves
* Next Week's pod goals:
  1. Submit all the homework on time
  2. Master all the material covered this week
  3. We're all going to use the Headspace meditation app this week for 10 minutes a day! :) (Allison is the lead
     on this, as she's been meditating for a couple years now.)
