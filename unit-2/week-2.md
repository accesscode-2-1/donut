### Weekly Retrospective

####1. Did you meet your weekly goals?
       NO.



####2. If not, which ones didn't you meet and why? 
        
       We did not meet the homework submission for this week due to: Work related (time management) conflicts. We also, have trouble 
       understanding the flow of the classes.  
       We're going to spend at least 3-5 hours this week on improving our previous projects, in 
       addition to our other class assignments, studying, and new homework.



####3. What will you do as a team to make sure you meet your goals next week?
      We are going to check in on Wednesday to check on each other to see if anyone needs help getting started on the homework,
      both via slack and in person during office hours.
